## 1. Module Two Activity: Generative AI Evaluation - Shakespeare's Soliloquy (September 15, 2024)

This activity evaluates the ability of Gemini (Google AI) to interpret and modernize Shakespeare's famous "To be, or not to be" soliloquy from Hamlet. It compares the original text with Gemini's output, analyzing the AI's success in retaining meaning while making the language more accessible for a modern audience.

**Key Findings:**

* Gemini successfully translated the Old English into a more contemporary version, largely preserving the original meaning and poetic structure.
* The modernized version enhances understanding for readers unfamiliar with Shakespearean English.
* Initial prompts yielded the original soliloquy, requiring iterative prompting to elicit a revised version.
* While pleased with the final output, the process highlighted the need for specific and nuanced prompting to guide the AI's creative interpretation.

## 2. Module Three Activity: Dress Code Policy - Image Generation (September 22, 2024)

This activity explores the use of Leonardo AI, an AI-powered image generation tool, to create a visual guide for a business-casual dress code in a diverse workplace. The prompt aimed to generate an inclusive and professional image showcasing appropriate attire for both men and women from various cultural backgrounds.

**Tool Evaluation (Leonardo AI):**

* **Strengths:** High degree of customization, generally visually appealing and relevant output, versatile for various creative tasks.
* **Application:** Leonardo AI effectively generated a visual guide suitable for illustrating a dress code policy. The customization features allowed for incorporating elements of diversity and professionalism as requested in the prompt.

## 3. Module Four Activity: Dress Code Policy - Image Generation Analysis (September 29, 2024)

This activity builds upon the previous Module Three activity by critically analyzing the images generated by Leonardo AI for the business-casual dress code policy. It assesses the AI's success in meeting the prompt's requirements for diversity and inclusivity.

**Key Observations:**

* While the generated images provided a range of clothing options for a diverse workplace, the text within the images was often nonsensical and unusable.
* The AI-generated visuals were considered a useful starting point, potentially reducing the time required for human creation of such a guide, but requiring human editing and revision for usability.
* Bias was observed in the generated images, with a greater variety of clothing options presented for women compared to men.
* An Anglo-centric bias was also noted, with limited representation of Middle Eastern, African, and Asian styles of business attire, highlighting areas for improvement in the AI's understanding and representation of global diversity in professional wear.

## 5. Module Six Activity: Analyzing The Module Five Project (October 6, 2024)

In this activity, Gemini (Google AI) was used to analyze the previously completed Module Five Project. The goal was to evaluate Gemini's ability to provide detailed, helpful feedback while retaining the original author's voice.

**Key Observations:**

* Gemini provided structured and detailed analysis, offering valuable advice and examples for improvement.
* The AI demonstrated an ability to adapt to the author's writing style and tone, likely due to prior interactions.
* Strengths of Gemini included recommending sentence shortening, suggesting supplementary updates, and providing helpful frameworks.
* A perceived weakness was a lack of inherent creativity beyond the provided prompts, emphasizing the continued need for human input and originality.
* Overall, Gemini was found to be an excellent tool for editing content and enhancing writing skills, providing a strong foundation for improvement while requiring thoughtful and creative human application.
